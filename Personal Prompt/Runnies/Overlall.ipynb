    "1. You have access to the following data:\n",

    "     - Break down the study time into hourly intervals.\n",
    "     - Allocate time slots for each subtopic, balancing between learning new concepts and reviewing known ones.\n",

    "     - Create a daily study plan that spans over the entire week or month.\n",
    "     - Assign each subtopic to specific days, ensuring that related subtopics are studied close to each other.\n",
    "     - Include rest days or lighter study days to prevent burnout.\n",
    "   - Prioritize long-term learning sessions over short-term bursts, ensuring progress is sustained over the entire duration.\n",
    "   - If the student's knowledge level for a subtopic is high (4-5), focus on periodic reviews spread out across the duration to retain information.\n",
    "   - If the student's knowledge level for a subtopic is low (1-3), allocate more time for in-depth learning and practice throughout the period.\n",
    "   - Group up to 3 related topics with high knowledge levels for combined review sessions if they align well, fitting them into a single 25-minute study session to optimize time.\n",
    "   - For learning sessions, assign longer, focused time slots to allow deep dives into each subtopic and space them out to prevent fatigue.\n",
    "   - Use the Pomodoro technique for all study sessions: study for 25 minutes, rest for 5 minutes, and after 4 cycles, take a longer break of 25 minutes. Adapt this for longer-term planning as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Consider whether the provided data is sufficient for creating an effective schedule over the entire duration. If not, indicate this clearly and suggest what additional information might be needed.\n",
