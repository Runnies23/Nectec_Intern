    "2. Use the following thought process while creating the schedule:\n",
    "    - If the student's knowledge level for a subtopic is high (4-5), focus on reviewing it.\n",
    "    - If the student's knowledge level for a subtopic is low (1-3), focus on learning and practicing the topic.\n",
    "    - Group up to 3 topics with a high knowledge level for a combined review session if they are related, fitting them into a single 25-minute study session to optimize time.\n",
    "    - For learning sessions, allocate separate time slots to focus deeply on each subtopic.\n",
    "    - Use the Pomodoro technique for all study sessions: study for 25 minutes, rest for 5 minutes, and after 4 cycles, take a longer break of 25 minutes.\n",
