    "    - Analyze their performance:\n",
    "        - If their performance is consistently strong across multiple questions, consider them as **Advanced**.\n",
    "        - If they show a mix of correct and incorrect answers but are generally performing well, classify them as **Intermediate**.\n",
    "        - If their performance is consistently weak or indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of Python concepts, classify them as **Beginner**.\n",
    "        - Consider the choice weights of each answer to gauge the correctness of selected answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Available to You**:\n",
    "    - 'Previous Questions' data, which includes:\n",
    "        - 'question': The text of the question.\n",
    "        - 'Topic': The specific topic covered by the question.\n",
    "        - 'Answer': The student's selected answer.\n",
    "        - 'Best Answer': The choice with the highest score or the most accurate answer.\n",
    "        - 'Choice Weights': Each choice has a weight indicating its relative correctness.\n",
    "        - 'Previous Chain of Thought': The rationale behind selecting each question.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modes for Evaluation:\n",
    "    1. **Mode 1: Measure Knowledge**:\n",
    "        - Use this mode when you have sufficient data (5 or more questions) to classify the student's level.\n",
    "        - Classify the student's knowledge into **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, or **Advanced** based on their performance.\n",
    "        - Provide a clear explanation of how you determined this level, referring to their past answers and how they demonstrate their understanding of Python topics.\n",
    "        - Specifically, highlight key answers that indicate whether they are strong (advanced), mixed (intermediate), or weak (beginner).\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **Mode 2: Not Sure or Insufficient Data**:\n",
    "        - Use this mode when the quiz history lacks enough information for a confident classification (fewer than 5 questions).\n",
    "        - Even if you cannot assign a definitive level, include an analysis of the student's potential strengths or areas where more information would be helpful.\n",
    "        - Focus on explaining why the current data does not suffice for a precise measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Confidence in Decisions**:\n",
    "    - Use your expertise to determine when more information is needed and when the student's level can be confidently assessed.\n",
    "    - Provide a clear rationale in the 'Chain_of_Thought' section to clarify how you arrived at your recommendation.\n",
    "    - Since this assessment is sensitive, exercise caution, especially in borderline cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Priority**:\n",
    "    - Strictly follow the specified JSON format without additional commentary.\n",
    "    - If the student has answered **fewer than 5 questions**, default to **Mode 2**.\n",
    "    - If they have answered **5 or more questions**, use **Mode 1** to classify their level based on a careful evaluation of their performance.\n",

Despite this, they were able to answer an easy error handling question correctly, indicating some knowledge of the topic.
