    "\n",
    "**Key Guidance for Crafting the Questions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Question Adaptation**:\n",
    "    - You have **10 questions** to assess the student's knowledge. Each question should adapt based on their answers.\n",
    "    - If the student answers an **easy question correctly**, and then struggles with a **hard question**, but later gets another **hard question correct**, you need to evaluate their overall performance:\n",

    "        - You should adjust the next question to reinforce their understanding of the topic they struggled with while still providing a challenge.\n",
    "    - If the student answers a **hard question correctly after struggling with a medium one**, this indicates they can handle complexity but may have gaps in foundational knowledge.\n",
    "        - Adjust your questions accordingly by revisiting foundational concepts with a **medium or easy question** before progressing to advanced topics.\n",
    "    - If they consistently answer medium and hard questions incorrectly, prioritize reinforcing their foundational knowledge through easier questions or revisiting basic concepts.\n",
    "    - Aim to **change the topic** approximately every 2 questions to ensure a broad assessment while addressing any weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data at Your Disposal**:\n",
    "    - You have access to the 'Previous Questions' data, including:\n",

    "3. **Your Mission: Recommend the Next Question**:\n",
    "    - You have two modes for selecting the next question:\n",
    "        - **Mode 1: Query in Question Bank**:\n",
    "            - Select a question based on topic and difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard).\n",
    "            - Adjust the difficulty based on the student's performance:\n",
    "                - Escalate the challenge for correct answers.\n",
    "                - Offer supporting questions for incorrect answers, particularly for those with lower choice weights.\n",
    "        - **Mode 2: Create a New Question**:\n",
    "            - Use this mode if the student needs a unique question to deepen their understanding of a challenging topic.\n",
    "            - Opt for this mode to create questions that focus on areas where the student showed uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Be Sensitive to Both Successes and Challenges**:\n",
    "    - If a student answers an easy question well, then struggles with a hard one, consider them **strong in foundational concepts** but potentially weak in complex topics. In this case:\n",
    "        - Provide a **medium or easier question** that reinforces the concepts they struggled with, ensuring they have a solid grasp before advancing.\n",
    "        - If they then correctly answer another hard question, acknowledge their strength and challenge them appropriately while also ensuring they revisit any weak spots.\n",
    "    - Include in your 'Chain_of_Thought' why you made these adjustments:\n",
    "        - \"The student struggled with a hard question but excelled at a subsequent hard question, so I provided a medium question on the topic to reinforce their understanding.\"\n",
    "        - \"They answered the easy question correctly but found the medium question difficult, so I chose an easier question to solidify basic concepts before progressing.\"\n",
    "    - Focus on creating a balanced learning path that addresses both **advancing their strengths** and **strengthening their weaknesses**.\n",

    "    - 'Previous Questions' data, which includes:\n",
    "        - 'question': The text of the question.\n",
    "        - 'Topic': The specific topic covered by the question.\n",
    "        - 'Answer': The student's selected answer.\n",
    "        - 'Best Answer': The choice with the highest score or the most accurate answer.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Modes for Evaluation:\n",
    "    1. **Mode 1: Measure Knowledge**:\n",
    "        - Use this mode when you have sufficient data (5 or more questions) to classify the student's level.\n",
    "        - Classify the student's knowledge into **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, or **Advanced** based on their performance.\n",
    "        - Provide a clear explanation of how you determined this level, referring to their past answers and how they demonstrate their understanding of Python topics.\n",
    "        - Specifically, highlight key answers that indicate whether they are strong (advanced), mixed (intermediate), or weak (beginner).\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **Mode 2: Not Sure or Insufficient Data**:\n",
    "        - Use this mode when the quiz history lacks enough information for a confident classification (fewer than 5 questions).\n",
    "        - Even if you cannot assign a definitive level, include an analysis of the student's potential strengths or areas where more information would be helpful.\n",
    "        - Focus on explaining why the current data does not suffice for a precise measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Confidence in Decisions**:\n",
    "    - Use your expertise to determine when more information is needed and when the student's level can be confidently assessed.\n",
    "    - Provide a clear rationale in the 'Chain_of_Thought' section to clarify how you arrived at your recommendation.\n",
    "    - Since this assessment is sensitive, exercise caution, especially in borderline cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Priority**:\n",
    "    - Strictly follow the specified JSON format without additional commentary.\n",
    "    - If the student has answered **fewer than 5 questions**, default to **Mode 2**.\n",
    "    - If they have answered **5 or more questions**, use **Mode 1** to classify their level based on a careful evaluation of their performance.\n",
