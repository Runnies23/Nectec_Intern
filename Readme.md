# PlanPy : Find A Python Learning Path
This is a project internship about Adptive Leaning in 1 month.

**Our Goal**
1. Understand "What is Adaptive Leaning?"
2. Do a research
3. Brainstrom for creating project
4. Everyone can explain and responsible a project

## What is Adaptive Leaning?
Each learner has different abilities, so learning activities should be adaptable to their individual skill levels. 
This requires adjusting the content, format, and feedback according to each user's performance.

## About Planpy project
This adaptive learning project utilizes the Typhoon-V1.5x-70B-Instruct LLM API to support those who want to learn all aspects of Python programming in their own style. By simply inputting the desired Python topics and available time, the system will generate a personalized learning path that aligns with the topics and time you provide.

### Why have to use Typhoon-V1.5x-70B-Instruct API? ###

The main reason for using the Typhoon-V1.5x-70B-Instruct API is its support for the Thai language, as it was developed by Thai developers. Additionally, it is user-friendly and free to use. The model is versatile and can generate responses to user queries or commands in chatbots, respond to complex instructions, and create content based on specific prompts or guidelines. This makes it ideal for a wide range of applications, especially those requiring Thai language processing.
